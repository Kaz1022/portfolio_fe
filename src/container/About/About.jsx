              <p>I decided to join a web development bootcamp after meditating on what I really want to do in my life! I want to keep learning, work remotely and be close to the family!</p><br/>
              <p>Ever since graduating from university, I have worked in a variety of industries, predominately customer service, in Japan, Australia and Canada. I have worked as a student counsellor, an English teacher,an airline customer service agent and a personal trainer and yoga instructor. Iâ€™ve always liked trying new things and learning new skills and excel at whatever I put my mind to.<br/>
